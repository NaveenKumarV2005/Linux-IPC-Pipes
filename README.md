# Ex03-Linux IPC - Pipes

# AIM:
To write a C program that illustrate communication between two process using unnamed and named pipes

# DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Navigate to any Linux environment installed on the system or installed inside a virtual environment like virtual box/vmware or online linux JSLinux (https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192) or docker.

### Step 2:

Write the C Program using Linux Process API - pipe(), fifo()

### Step 3:

Testing the C Program for the desired output.
